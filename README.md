# LPG-Bot
A bot multitask for my Discord Server named : **LaPlanqueGaming**
## Current features

 - When you type "!ping" it answer "Pong" - Awesome !

## config.json
You need to create a '**config.json**' file where you'll save the Token of your bot.
The token is available in the Discord API.

The syntax of your config file should be like :

    {
      "Token": "YOUR TOKEN",
      "BotPrefix": "!"
    }


The BotPrefix is the prefix before the bot command. Like "!command".
